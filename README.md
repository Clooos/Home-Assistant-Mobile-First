# Home Assistant - Mobile First Dashboard
Almost 3 years ago a friend told me about Home Assistant, I loved the idea and the open source side of it. I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and quickly felt in love. I've uploaded this project to inspired the community.

There is no installation process, this is my personal setup uploaded as is, it's a "learn, copy and try what you can come up with".

Thank vou all. vou are a great motivation!
